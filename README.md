# Learning Blog

An amazing blog to practice the tools learned in Platzi's courses on git and Github.

>The Platzi's course on git and Github is just what I needed to get more money in my job, and so I will be able to jump toward the machine learning industry.

In this course we saw a lot of things:

* All git commands
* The Github workflow
* The true love for good practices
* Crazy teaches tricks
* Freddy's Multiple personalities

And as a friendly reminder:
If you get here, don't be so serious ^^This README.md is a joke^^. Designed just as an example. ItÂ´s better that you keep on with the course.
